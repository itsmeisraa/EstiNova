# 🚀 EstiNova — Intelligent Centralized Assistant (AI ERP)

> Projet Pluridisciplinaire · ESTIN 2025/2026  
> ⚠️ Status: In Development

---

## 🧠 Overview

EstiNova is an AI-powered ERP system designed for ESTIN to centralize all academic and administrative information into a single intelligent assistant.

Instead of navigating PDFs, emails, or WhatsApp groups, users can simply ask questions in natural language and receive instant, contextual, and personalized answers.

The system uses a multi-agent architecture combined with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to provide accurate and secure responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🔁 System Flow

1. User sends a message via chatbot  
2. Frontend sends request via webhook  
3. User context is retrieved (role, group, etc.)  
4. Main AI Agent routes request  
5. Specialized agent processes it  
6. Response is generated and returned
